### Introduction
Swift is a powerful and intuitive general-purpose programming language developed by Apple. It was created with the intent to write applications for iOS, watchOS, macOS, tvOS, Linux.

In swift we print text like this `print("Hello, world!")` and can print special characters `print("ðŸš™ðŸ’¨")`.<br>
Single-line-comments look like this `// MyComment` and multi-line `/* MyComment */`.

Files for programming in swift have the '.swift' extension.

Xcode is an IDE specially developed by Apple for software on iOS, watchOS, macOS, iPadOS, tvOS.<br>
However sometimes it is easier to develop swift programs simply in the terminal. You can verify your swift like this `swift --version`, compile `swiftc <filename>.swift` and execute `./<executable>`.

### Variables
Here is an example of how to declare a variable `var score = 0`, that we can later print for example `print(score)`.<br>
Usually in swift we format variable names in camelCase.

Variables can equal digits and can be used with **arithmetic operators** to calculate such as; + (addition), - (substraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulo, divides and gives remainder).<br>
Instead of writing `age = age + 1` we can use 'compound assignment operators' and write `age += 1` and this is valid for all arithmetic operators.

If we want to be clear about the kind of value stored in variable we can use **type annotation**. Here are some basic data types; Int (integer number), Double (floating-point number), String (sequence of characters), Bool (true/false values). Here is an example of a variable declaration with type annotation `var artist: String`.<br>
This is useful by throwing warnings or errors if the given value is not of specified type.

**String interpolation** means inserting a variable's value into a string, in swift we do it like this; `"This is the string and here comes the interpolation \(myVariable)"`.

**Constants** are variable containing an immutable value, they are used as a safety measure and declared with keyword let, `let variable`.
